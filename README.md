Infrared image super-resolution based on circuit-level priors of infrared imaging principles. We draw inspiration from the readout circuit prior to Uncooled Infrared Focal Plane Arrays (IRFPA),
which scans infrared signals row by row and reads them out column by column. We propose an efficient Row-Column Transformer Block (RCTB) that splits features into rows and columns to effectively capture the spatio-temporal correlation between row-column pixels. Acknowledging the continuity of temperature information within the image and the correlation between adjacent pixel regions, we develop a Compact Convolution Block (CCB) that incorporates a U-shape Spatial Channel Attention Block (USCAB) to extract local features before the RCTB. During the training phase, we introduce a regularization control term into the loss function to enhance the reconstruction details of the infrared image. Building on these components, we propose a hybrid network named Efficient Infrared Image Super-Resolution (EIRSR), which achieves an excellent balance between performance and efficiency in terms of parameters and computational costs.

We construct a high-quality, large-scale infrared image dataset. The uncooled infrared images are acquired using both custom-developed devices and commercial infrared imaging systems, with additional data sourced from public datasets.
